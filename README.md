## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Run both servers simultaneously (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev:all
```
This will start both the React development server and the JSON database server.

#### Option 2: Run servers separately
In one terminal:
```bash
npm run server
```
This starts the JSON database server on port 3002.

In another terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the React development server.

### Database

The application uses JSON Server as a mock database. The database file (`db.json`) contains:
- Users (with roles: user, moderator, admin)
- Games (with pricing, descriptions, and media)
- Comments and reviews
- Purchase history

### Admin Access

Default admin credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
